# Rocker Bogie Suspension Vehicle Project

This project was created during my second year of B.Tech to explore the mechanics of the **Rocker Bogie Suspension System**. This vehicle helped me gain hands-on experience with **Arduino**, basic electronics, and simple circuits.

## Project Overview

The **Rocker Bogie Suspension Vehicle** is a type of rover widely used in planetary exploration, such as on NASA’s Mars rovers. The vehicle’s suspension system allows it to traverse rough terrain, and it is commonly used in robotics competitions and learning projects.

### Key Features:
- **Rocker Bogie Suspension**: Enables smooth traversal over uneven surfaces.
- **Arduino-controlled**: The movement of the vehicle is managed using an Arduino board, with inputs from various sensors.
- **Simple Circuitry**: Includes motor control circuits, basic sensors, and wiring for the vehicle's movement.

## Circuit Diagram

Here is a basic schematic of the circuit used for the vehicle:

## Working Mechanism

The **Rocker Bogie Suspension System** works by:
- Distributing the vehicle’s weight across six wheels.
- Allowing the vehicle to climb obstacles twice the height of the wheel radius.
- Keeping the body of the vehicle stable, ensuring minimal disturbance to onboard sensors.

The Arduino is programmed to control the motors and handle sensor inputs, allowing for semi-autonomous movement over uneven terrain.

## Sample Output

## Lessons Learned

While working on this project, I learned:
- Basics of **Arduino programming** and its integration with motors and sensors.
- Designing **simple circuits** and troubleshooting electrical components.
- Building a mechanically sound suspension system and understanding its real-world applications.

## Future Improvements

In the future, I would like to:
- Implement **autonomous navigation** using advanced sensors like LIDAR or Ultrasonic sensors.
- Improve the efficiency of the motor control using **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)**.
- Integrate wireless control through Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.

## Technologies Used

- **Arduino**: For controlling the vehicle and managing input/output operations.
- **DC Motors**: To drive the wheels.
- **Sensors**: Basic proximity and obstacle detection sensors for navigation.
- **Mechanical Design**: Rocker bogie suspension setup for rough terrain traversal.
